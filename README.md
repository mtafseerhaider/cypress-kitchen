# Cypress Kitchen

I have created this repo to dive deep into Cypress by cooking some delicious and commonly consumed recipes in software test automation. I pay huge tribute to Applitools and its team to provide a free website to practice Cypress and some very useful recipes as well.

This README includes information about the project structure and instructions to execute the tests on all the three different versions of Applifashion application.

## Technologies

- Cypress v7.4.0 - for functional UI testing
- Applitool Eyes for Cypress v3.22.0 - for visual testing

### External Libraries Used

- Node.js:fs-extra v9.0.4 - for adding promise support to the fs methods

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for evaluating my effort on this challenge.

1. Clone https://github.com/mtafseerhaider/cypress-kitchen.git locally

2. **cd cypress-kitchen** if you are not on this directory

3. **npm i** to install the project dependencies

4. Add your Applitools API Key to your system environment variables
   Use **export APPLITOOLS_API_KEY= {yourAPIKey}** if you are on MacOs or Linux
   Use **set APPLITOOLS_API_KEY= {yourAPIKey}** if you are on Windows

5. Execute below command to run tests
